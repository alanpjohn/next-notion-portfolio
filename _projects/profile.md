# Hi, I am Alan, A twenty-six year old software engineer from Kerala based in Manchester, UK.

I graduated with my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from the Army Institute of Technology, Pune, in July 2021. After working a year as a software developer at HSBC, I pursued my Master of Science in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Manchester, graduating with Distinction in Dec 2023. I am currently working as the Cloud Engineer at Samey AI, a B2B AI company for Legal and Accounting Firms.

My primary area of interest and research is distributed computed and cloud computing loving to see how problems evolve at scale and how engineers compromise to get just the right balance between ensuring that the solution performs at scale and overengineering them. I have experience working with various cloud platforms, including AWS and Azure handling kubernetes clusters, data pipelines, serverless architecture and distributed computing. I have experience developing backend systems in Golang and Python with a few personal projects using Rust as well.

In addition to my technical skills, I'm passionate about contributing to open-source projects and networking with like-minded individuals. Outside of work, I enjoy photography and editing. I'm always eager to discuss technology, design, or football and would love to connect with others in the field.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in learning more about my experience or discussing potential opportunities. I look forward to hearing from you!
